# PDFbot: A Chatbot that Interacts with PDFs

PDFbot is an interactive chatbot designed to communicate with the contents of a PDF. With PDFbot, you can engage in a conversation with any PDF file to extract information, ask questions, and gain insights. This project contains multiple modules to support various environments, including both local implementations and integration with OpenAI.

## Features
- **Chat with any PDF**: Ask questions about a PDF and receive intelligent responses.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Use it locally or with OpenAI for different levels of interaction.
- **Gradio UI**: A user-friendly interface to interact with PDFbot locally.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three major modules:

1. **PDFbot with OpenAI Integration**  
   - Located in a Jupyter Notebook (`PDFBot.ipynb`).
   - This module connects to OpenAI to process PDF content and generate responses based on your queries.

2. **Local PDFbot (Jupyter Notebook)**  
   - Located in a Jupyter Notebook (`PDFBot_Ollama.ipynb`).
   - This version runs entirely on your local machine, processing the PDF without any external API calls.

3. **Local PDFbot with Gradio**  
   - Contained within the `PDFBot_Py/` folder.
   - Provides a local implementation using Gradio, allowing you to interact with PDFbot through a simple web interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:AKxy4321/PDFBot.git
   cd PDFBot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can use the `requirements.txt` file for easy setup:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt (Only requirements for PDFBot_Ollama is given, go to PDFBot.ipynb to get OpenAI requirements)
   ```

3. **Run Locally**
   - **For Local Notebook**: Open `PDFBot_Ollama.ipynb` and run the cells.
   - **For Gradio Interface**: Navigate to the `PDFBot_Py/` folder and run:
     ```bash
     python PDFBot.py
     ```

4. **Use OpenAI**  
   - Open the `PDFBot.ipynb` file and follow the instructions to configure your OpenAI API key.

## How to Use

- Give a pdf path and ask questions about its content. PDFbot will retrieve relevant information and provide insightful responses.
- Choose between local processing or leveraging OpenAIâ€™s capabilities for more advanced interactions.
- Use the Gradio interface for an easy-to-use, browser-based experience.

## Future Improvements
- Expand support for more file formats.
- Improve accuracy and context-awareness in conversations.
- Add additional customization options for local use and Gradio integration.
